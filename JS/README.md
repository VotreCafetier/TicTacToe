# TicTacToe Game
Vanilla JS

## Next features
- A 'Quit' button (icon) which reset the game
- Dark and Light theme
- Pick a color for player which influences what color is the background of the player (if not selected random color)
- Opening animation
- Reset animation
- shortcuts numpad or number
- Error framework
- Change name option in end overlay
- Add Player 1 vs Player 2 in name overlay
- Add smash intro when reset

# To fix
- Responsive
- One decimal point for random confetti
- Better code for handleReset
- Switch name api to random FANTASY name (would be cooler)
- Show nothing in html until page is fully loaded, then show (preloader)


## Ideas
- hand writing with sound when playing
- startup animation (drawing the table)
- match system (1 - 0, 2 - 0)?
