# TicTacToe Game
Vanilla JS


## Next features
- Dark and Light theme
- Pick a color for player which influences what color is the background of the player (if not selected random color)
- XD interface
- Opening animation
- Reset animation
- Check and alert if cors are not enabled
- shortcuts numpad or number

# To fix
- Responsive
- When random name, clear to match regex
- Close overlay in reset, not in every goddamn shit
- Better code for handleReset
- If draw, then no confetti
- fix verify input name overlay : only first input is okay


# Ideas
- hand writing with sound when playing
