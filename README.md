# TicTacToe Game
Vanilla JS

## Next features
- Dark and Light theme
- Pick a color for player which influences what color is the background of the player (if not selected random color)
- Opening animation
- Reset animation
- shortcuts numpad or number
- Error framework
- Change name option in end overlay

# To fix
- Responsive
- When random name, clear to match regex
- Better code for handleReset
- If draw, then no confetti
- Switch name api to random FANTASY name (would be cooler)


## Ideas
- hand writing with sound when playing
- startup animation (drawing the table)
- match system (1 - 0, 2 - 0)?
